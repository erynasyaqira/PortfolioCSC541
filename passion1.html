       <strong>Mukbang</strong>:
       Mukbang videos can offer a unique form of emotional and 
       relief by providing a sense of companionship and comfort.
       The intimate and engaging nature of these videos allows 
       viewers to feel connected to the host, combating feelings
       of loneliness and isolation. The visual and auditory stimuli
       of watching and hearing someone eat can evoke a soothing,
       ASMR-like response, which helps in reducing stress and anxiety.

       <strong>Sunset</strong>:
       Watching a sunset can be a deeply therapeutic experience,
       offering a moment of calm and reflection amidst the chaos
       of daily life. The gradual transition of the sky from day 
       to night, with its stunning array of colors, can evoke
       feelings of peace and awe. This natural spectacle allows
       me to slow down, focus on the present moment, and appreciate 
       the beauty of the world around me. The gentle fading of light
       can also symbolize closure and the end of a day, providing 
       a sense of completion and renewal. This simple yet profound 
       experience can help reduce stress, enhance mood, and foster 
       a sense of connection with nature, contributing to overall
       mental well-being.
